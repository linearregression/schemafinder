= Introduction =

This page will assist you in installing schemafinder.

= Prerequisites =

Prerequisites:
  1. gnu make
  1. working erlang installation.
     * debian: aptitude install erlang-dev
     * os/x (with [http://www.finkproject.org/ fink]): apt-get install erlang-otp
     * freebsd: pkg_add -r erlang
     * others: ???
  1. [http://support.process-one.net/doc/display/CONTRIBS/EUnit eunit] from process one
  1. [http://code.google.com/p/gencron gencron]
  1. [http://code.google.com/p/nodefinder combonodefinder]

Unpack the [http://code.google.com/p/schemafinder/downloads/list tarball], then run configure and make check.
{{{
# tar -zxf schemafinder-2.0.1.tar.gz 
# cd schemafinder-2.0.1
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make -s check
}}}
The default prefix is {{{/usr}}} so if you are ok with that then you can omit the prefix argument.  Hopefully you will see something like[[#1 1]]
{{{
...
PASS: test-disaster
==================
All 6 tests passed
==================
}}}
If not, the test output for test foo is in {{{tests/test-foo.out}}}; perhaps it is informative.

Now you can {{{make install}}} to stick stuff on your system.

= Footnotes =

== 1 ==
If you see something like:
{{{
fw requires GNU make to build, you are using bsd make
*** Error code 1

Stop.
}}}
Then you are using bsd make which will not work.  Try again with gnu make, e.g.,
{{{
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && gmake -s check
}}}
